                Of Programe so call it as example.com ) so Enjoy The Finding And If You Think I Did Any Mistake Please

                Vulnerability Type : 
                <br>Business Logic Flaws / Broken Access Control
                <br>
                <br>
                Let's Discuss About Logic/Working Of Application !
                <br><br>
                It Is Well Known Web Application For Travel Professionals or Businesses To Arrange Trips And Share Trips
                Information With Customers Or Team Members . It Has Admin User (Trip Organizer) And Team Member (Normal
                User) Functionality. When Admin Add An User As Team Member (Let Call It As User 2 ) In The Application,
                All The Trips Info Is Shared With User 2. Now User 2 Can See The Trip Information and Other Basic
                Details Such As Trip Duration Location etc . User 2 Also Have Functionality To Make PDF Of Trip
                Information [ ease For Offline Usage ].
            </p>
            <!-- <img src="/assests/assets/img/write.jpg"  alt="POC Screenshot"> -->
            <img src="/assets/img/write.jpg" alt="POC Screenshot" class="poc-img">
            <p class="part-two font">
                Here, Id parameter Is <b> Trip ID </b> Which Is Always Same For A particular Trip And In Response URL Path Of PDF
                Is Shown . Vulnerability Was Lies Here .
                <br>
                <br>
                <b> Steps To Reproduce The Vulnerability : </b><br><br>
                1. Admin add An User As Team Member , All The Trip Information Is Shared With User 2<br><br>
                2. User generate PDF Of Trip And Capture The Request In Burp Suite<br><br>
                3. Now Admin Removed User 2 From Team Then User 2 Does Not Have Access To The Trip Information But The
                User 2 Have ID Of Trip So He/She Can Generate PDF Using That ID Anytime With The Help Of Request Which
                We Kept In Burp Repeater.<br><br>
                4. Whenever Admin Do Any Changes In Trip Like Location Date Time Price And Then If User 2 Generate PDF
                Using The Vulnerable Endpoint, New PDF Will Generate Each Time With Updated Information i.e Updated Date
                Time Location<br><br>
            </p>
            <p class="part-three font">
                <br>
                In-Short :)
                    <br>
                Generate PDF Endpoint Is Vulnerable To IDOR But Attacker Can Only Get ID Of Trip If He/She Was Previous
                Member Of Trip .

                <br>
